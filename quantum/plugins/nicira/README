-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview and pre-requisites

    This is a Quantum plugin that can talk to a set of NVP controllers and
    implements the core Quantum v2 api.  In order to use it you must have
    Nicira NVP running and configured.  You must also have Quantum installed
    and configured.

NVP Plugin configuration

    1) Database configuration
    The NVP plugin leverages the Quantum database. The following connection
    parameters should be specified:
    - sql_connection: Database connection string
    - sql_max_retries: Maximum number of connection attempts (default 10)
    - reconnect_interval: Gap between connection attempts (default 2 seconds)
    2) NVP (general)
    - max_lp_per_bridged_ls: Maximum number of ports of a logical switch on a
    bridged transport zone (default 64)
    - concurrent_connections: Number of connects to each controller node
    (default 3)
    - nvp_gen_timout: Number of seconds a generation id should be valid for
    (default -1 meaning do not time out)
    3) NVP cluster
    By default the Quantum NVP plugin can talk to multiple controllers in a
    single cluster. In the future (Havana+) support for multiple clusters
    will be added.
    The following parameters can be configured:
    - default_tz_uuid: This is uuid of the default NVP Transport zone that
      will be used for creating tunneled isolated "Quantum" networks. It
      needs to be created in NVP before starting Quantum with the nvp plugin.
    - nvp_cluster_uuid: Optional paramter identifying the UUID of the cluster
      in NVP.  This can be retrieved from NVP management console "admin" section.
    - nvp_controllers: describes the list of controllers
    More details can be found in etc/quantum/plugins/nicira/nvp.ini
