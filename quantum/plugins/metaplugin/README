# -- Background

This plugin supports multiple plugin at same time. This plugin is for L3 connectivility
between networks which are realized by different plugins.This plugin adds new attributes 'flavor:network' and 'flavor:router".
flavor:network corresponds to specific l2 plugin ( flavor-plugin mapping could be configureable by plugin_list config.
flavor:router corresponds to specific l3 plugin ( flavor-plugin mapping could be configureable by l3_plugin_list config. Note that Metaplugin can provide l3 functionaliteis for l2 plugin which didn't support l3 extension yet.
This plugin also support extensions. We can map extension to plugin by using extension_map config.

[database]
# This line MUST be changed to actually run the plugin.
# Example:
# connection = mysql://root:nova@127.0.0.1:3306/ovs_quantum
# Replace 127.0.0.1 above with the IP address of the database used by the
# main quantum server. (Leave it as is if the database runs on this host.)
connection = mysql://root:password@localhost/quantum_metaplugin?charset=utf8

# Database reconnection retry times - in event connectivity is lost
# set to -1 implgies an infinite retry count
# max_retries = 10
# Database reconnection interval in seconds - in event connectivity is lost
retry_interval = 2

[meta]

# -- BridgeDriver Configration
# In order to use metaplugin, you should use MetaDriver. Following configation is needed.

[DEFAULT]
# Meta Plugin
# Mapping between flavor and driver
meta_flavor_driver_mappings = openvswitch:quantum.agent.linux.interface.OVSInterfaceDriver, linuxbridge:quantum.agent.linux.interface.BridgeInterfaceDriver

# -- Agent
Agents for Metaplugin are in quantum/plugins/metaplugin/agent
linuxbridge_quantum_agent and ovs_quantum_agent is available.

# -- Extensions

- flavor
MetaPlugin supports flavor and provider net extension.
Metaplugin select plugin_list using flavor.
One plugin may use multiple flavor value. If the plugin support flavor, it may provide
multiple flavor of network.

- Attribute extension
Each plugin can use attribute extension such as provider_net, if you specify that in supported_extension_aliases.

- providernet
Vlan ID range of each plugin should be different, since Metaplugin dose not manage that.

#- limitations

Basically, All plugin should inherit QuantumDBPluginV2.
Metaplugin assumes all plugin share same Database expecially for IPAM part in QuantumV2 API.
You can use another plugin if you use ProxyPluginV2, which proxies request to the another quantum server.

Example flavor configration for ProxyPluginV2

meta_flavor_driver_mappings = "openvswitch:quantum.agent.linux.interface.OVSInterfaceDriver,proxy:quantum.plugins.metaplugin.proxy_quantum_plugin.ProxyPluginV2"

- Limited L3 support
In folsom version, l3 is an extension. There is no way to extend exntension attributes.
so you can set flavor:router value but you can't get flavor:router value in API output.
L3 agent dont's support flavor:router.
