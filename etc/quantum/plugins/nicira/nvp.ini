# #############################################################
# WARNINGS: The following deprecations have been made in the
# Havana release. Support for the options below will be removed
# in Ixxx.
#
# Section: [DEFAULT], Option: 'metadata_dhcp_host_route'
# Remarks: Use 'enable_isolated_metadata' in dhcp_agent.ini.
#
#
# Section: [cluster:name], Option: 'nvp_controller_connection'
# Remarks: The configuration will allow the specification of
#          a single cluster, therefore [cluster:name] is no
#          longer used.  Use 'nvp_*', options, 'req_timeout',
#          'retries', etc. as indicated in the DEFAULT section.
#          Support for multiple clusters will be added through
#          an API extension.
