# (ListOpt) List of network type driver entrypoints to be loaded from
# the quantum.ml2.type_drivers namespace.
#
# type_drivers = local,flat,vlan
# Example: type_drivers = flat,vlan,gre

# (ListOpt) Ordered list of network_types to allocate as tenant
# networks. The default value 'local' is useful for single-box testing
# but provides no connectivity between hosts.
#
# tenant_network_types = local
# Example: tenant_network_types = vlan,gre

[ml2_type_flat]
# (ListOpt) List of physical_network names with which flat networks
# can be created. Use * to allow flat networks with arbitrary
# physical_network names.
#
# flat_networks =
# Example:flat_networks = physnet1,physnet2
# Example:flat_networks = *

[ml2_type_vlan]
# (ListOpt) List of <physical_network>[:<vlan_min>:<vlan_max>] tuples
# specifying physical_network names usable for VLAN provider and
# tenant networks, as well as ranges of VLAN tags on each
# physical_network available for allocation as tenant networks.
#
# network_vlan_ranges =
# Example: network_vlan_ranges = physnet1:1000:2999,physnet2
