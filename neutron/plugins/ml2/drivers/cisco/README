Neutron ML2 Cisco Mechanism Drivers README

Cisco mechanism drivers implement the ML2 driver APIs for managing
Cisco devices.

Notes:
The initial version of the Cisco Nexus driver supports only the
VLAN network type on a single physical network.

Provider networks are not currently supported.

The Cisco Nexus mechanism driver's database may have duplicate entries also
found in the core ML2 database. Since the Cisco Nexus DB code is a port from
the plugins/cisco implementation this duplication will remain until the
plugins/cisco code is deprecated.
